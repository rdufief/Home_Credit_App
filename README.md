# Home_Credit_App
Made by rdufief
 
This app has been designed to evaluate a level of risk associated with a credit application.

The model grants a "risky" or "unrisky" label to a credit application.
Results are published in an online Dashboard made with Streamlit, that explains why the credit has been granted or refused, and compares the application with similar ones.

This is a personal project, using data from the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, available at https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/home-credit-default-risk-extensive-eda/data.
